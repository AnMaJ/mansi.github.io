# Mansi — Personal Website

Hey, I am Mansi, I am currently doing a Masters of Research in AI and ML at Imperial College London

This is a simple, responsive single-page site ready for GitHub Pages.

## How to deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository named `mansi.github.io` (replace `mansi` with your GitHub username if different).
2. Copy the files in this folder to the repo root and push to `main`.
3. In GitHub → Settings → Pages, ensure Source is set to `Deploy from a branch: main /(root)`.
4. Wait ~2 minutes, then visit `https://<your-username>.github.io`.

## Customize

- Replace the portrait image in `assets/` and update references if needed.
- Update links and text in `index.html` if needed.
- Edit styles in `styles.css`.

## Local preview

Open `index.html` in a browser, or use a local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```
